  <h1>Whale</h1>
  <img src="whale.jpg"width="700">
  <p> Whales roam throughout all of the world's oceans, communicating with complex and mysterious sounds. Their sheer size amazes us: the blue whale can reach lengths of more than 100 feet and weigh up to 200 tonsâ€”as much as 33 elephants.</p>
  <p>Despite living in the water, whales breathe air. And like humans, they are warm-blooded mammals who nurse their young. A thick layer of fat called blubber insulates them from cold ocean waters.</p>
